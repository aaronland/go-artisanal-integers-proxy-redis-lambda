# go-artisanal-integers-proxy-redis-lambda

Go package for using Redis-backed artisanal integer proxy servers in AWS Lambda functions.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

# Important

THIS DOES NOT WORK YET. No.
